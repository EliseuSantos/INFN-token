Welcome to the INFN Token project! This repository contains a Solidity smart contract to create and manage the INFN (INFINITE) token on the Ethereum blockchain. The INFN Token is an ERC-20 standard token following common specifications for interoperability and compatibility with other platforms and applications.

## About INFN Token

The INFN Token is a digital asset representing a unit of value on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables the transfer of value quickly, efficiently, and in a decentralized manner without relying on intermediaries. The token follows the ERC-20 standard, meaning it can be easily integrated into wallets, exchanges, and other applications compatible with this standard.

## Key Features

- **ERC-20 Standard**: Follows common Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) 20 specifications for fungible tokens.
- **Fast and Global Transactions**: Transfer tokens instantly to anyone, anywhere in the world.
- **Permission Control**: Ability to approve other addresses to spend tokens on your behalf.
- **Contract Auditability**: The smart contract is transparent and can be publicly audited on the Ethereum blockchain.

## How to Use

To start using the INFN Token, you can follow these steps:

1. **Contract Deployment**: Deploy the `INFNToken.sol` contract on a compatible Ethereum network.
2. **Interact with the Contract**: Interact with the deployed contract using a user interface or direct contract calls.
3. **Integration into Applications**: Integrate the INFN Token into your Ethereum wallet, exchange, or other ERC-20 token-compatible application.
